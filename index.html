        <p>“The Creatures of One’s Mind” is a 3D animated short that was created as part of UConn’s Digital Media & Design 2023 B.F.A. Senior Project. The film itself is centered around the theme of inner mental struggle. The short film stars a man going about his mundane daily routine. A small creature appear out of thin air one day and follows him around and prevents him from doing important tasks. No matter how many time he separate himself from the creatures, it keep coming back bigger and stronger. The man eventually comes to terms with the creatures and lives alongside each other.
          

          The Creature represent the inner demon within our mind, whether that’s alcoholism, depression, stress, grief or depression, We have constant battle with them everyday. The demon inside our head tell us stories, sometimes to encourage us to take action and other times to discourage us from doing so.
          

          The creature models are created in 3D Coat, with animation, rigging, and rendering done in Cinema 4D. The environment and background assets are also designed and created in Cinema 4D.

To complement the design, we selected a warm and inviting color palette that conveys the cozy atmosphere of Dog Lane Café.
